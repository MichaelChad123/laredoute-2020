Laredoute Coding Task 2020

In this repository you will find the designated homepage task as well as the email task.

The carousel on the homepage task is an autoplayed carousel which will trigger after 6 seconds. You can also swipe on it to change the carousel or click one of two dots at the bottom of the carousel.

All other homepage content is responsive using bootstrap framework as requested in the brief.

The email section of this repository contains the index.html as well as another folder locating the images for the hero and the products in the email. All products and hero are linked as per requested in the brief and all images in the shoe section are image mapped via html.

Thank you.
